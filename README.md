## 2. How to Add Swagger UI, Redoc and RapiDoc to a Rust API

In this article, you will learn how to integrate Swagger UI, Redoc, and RapiDoc into a Rust API project. Yes, we will be generating three documentation UIs, but don't worry, the process is straightforward, and we won't need to write the OpenAPI YAML or JSON configurations manually.
